However, with the rise of individualism, begotten partly by Protestantism and capitalism, the links between duty in a society and happiness were gradually broken. The consequence was a redefinition of the moral terms. Happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life, but in terms of individual psychology. Happiness, however, remains a difficult term for moral philosophy. Throughout the history of moral philosophy, there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness and attempts to define morality in terms that have nothing to do with happiness at all\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# word tokenize input texts\n","text = word_tokenize(magzine_text)\n","\n","# removing stopwords from sentences so we will have only root words and imp words\n","magzine_filtered_sen = []\n","for w in text:\n","  if w not in stop_words:\n","    magzine_filtered_sen.append(w)\n","\n","# finding frequency of words\n","from nltk.probability import FreqDist\n","fdist = FreqDist()\n","\n","for words in magzine_filtered_sen:\n","  fdist[words.lower()]+=1\n","fdist"],"metadata":{"id":"SV2F3qtlKebt","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1639490449534,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"jyoti jauhari","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"17387539765828956621"}},"outputId":"dd9b14a0-f851-4442-81f7-e4a876a84483"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["FreqDist({'attempts': 2,\n","          'begotten': 1,\n","          'broken': 1,\n","          'capitalism': 1,\n","          'certain': 2,\n","          'christianity': 1,\n","          'concerned': 1,\n","          'consequence': 1,\n","          'consequences': 1,\n","          'define': 2,\n","          'defined': 1,\n","          'difficult': 1,\n","          'duty': 1,\n","          'european': 1,\n","          'gradually': 1,\n","          'greeks': 1,\n","          'happiness': 6,\n","          'history': 1,\n","          'however': 2,\n","          'individual': 1,\n","          'individualism': 1,\n","          'inherited': 1,\n","          'kind': 2,\n","          'leading': 1,\n","          'life': 2,\n","          'linked': 1,\n","          'links': 1,\n","          'longer': 1,\n","          'moral': 3,\n","          'morality': 3,\n","          'nothing': 1,\n","          'often': 1,\n","          'oscillation': 1,\n","          'partly': 1,\n","          'performance': 1,\n","          'philosophy': 2,\n","          'protestantism': 1,\n","          'psychology': 1,\n","          'redefinition': 1,\n","          'relation': 1,\n","          'remains': 1,\n","          'rise': 1,\n","          'role': 1,\n","          'social': 2,\n","          'societies': 1,\n","          'society': 1,\n","          'term': 1,\n","          'terms': 4,\n","          'the': 1,\n","          'throughout': 1,\n","          'traditional': 1})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]}]}
